<h1>Arduino and AVR Ethernet modules</h1>

<a href="index.html">Back to homepage</a>

<p>
  Full-sized Arduinos such as the Uno together with official or cloned Ethernet shields
  are easy to use as all the electronics connections and components are well-designed, tested,
  and the software stack supports these exact configurations.

  However, trying to use cheaper modules such as the ENC28J60 or WIZnet W5100 or W5500 can be tricky
  because the connections have to be made from scratch. On this page I describe my issues while tring
  to get these modules to work, and document working wiring and software.
